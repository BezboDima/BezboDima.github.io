I am very excited to announce that i am starting my Master of Science in Computer Science at Montana State University. I am currently on the Masters thesis track and hope to dive deep into th field of Data Science and Machine Learning. While in my first year in Masters I will also take part in Montana state Men's tennis team. Being a graduate student athlete requires great time management, hard work, and consistancy, which I am looking to improve during my time here at MSU. I am looking forward to it and hope to get a ton of knowledge and expertise, which can be applied in my future professional career.

Some of the Courses that I will be taking this semester are:
- Methods of Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Advanced Data Mining 
- Algorithms Design
