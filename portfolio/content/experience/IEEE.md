### Description
Made significant enhancements to the IEEE project proposal system, which enables scientists to submit proposals and request funding from the Committee. This system features a React-based frontend, PHP backend, and MySQL as the primary database. Key contributions include:

- **Enhanced Document Handling**: Implemented functionality to convert and download proposals as PDF files, addressing issues with saving documents containing illegal characters and replacing Word file downloads. Integrated the dompdf library to facilitate PDF generation, improving document management and accessibility.
- **Proposal Submission and Project Duration Fixes**: Restricting proposal submissions to only the next year and enforcing a fixed three-year duration for projects, ensuring consistent and accurate project planning and management within the system.
- **Improved Proposal Display and Bulk Operations**: Added functionality to display proposal types (initiative or operating) in the proposal list for better categorization. Additionally, introduced batch download capabilities for projects and ranking functionalities for admin users, streamlining administrative processes and enhancing usability.
