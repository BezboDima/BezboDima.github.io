### Description

During my internship at Workiva, I played a key role in improving and expanding the companyâ€™s document translation and financial reporting systems. My work spanned multiple areas of the product, from fixing critical bugs to building new features that enhanced reliability and user experience.

A major focus of my contributions was the financial reporting software tailored for the UK region. I collaborated closely with the engineering team to implement improvements that were successfully shipped and are now used by more than 20,000 customers, directly strengthening the accuracy and trustworthiness of their reporting workflows.

I was also responsible for leading the transition of several projects toward the use of RESTful APIs, ensuring a smooth migration that maintained full customer satisfaction and avoided disruption to ongoing reporting processes. In addition, I contributed to the improvement of import and export pipelines (DOCX, PDF, XHTML, and other formats) that power reporting for 2,000+ businesses, helping streamline their operations and reduce reporting delays.

Beyond product features, I also contributed to CI/CD pipeline optimization and unit testing improvements, which reduced the likelihood of errors reaching production and strengthened overall code quality across the engineering team.
