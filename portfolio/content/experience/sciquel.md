### Description

I had the opportunity to contribute to a [**scientific article website**](https://www.sciquel.org/) alongside a talented team of junior developers. The goal was to make scientific knowledge more accessible to individuals with non-technical backgrounds. This involved designing user-friendly interfaces and implementing features that simplify complex information, ensuring that the website effectively bridges the gap between scientific content and everyday users.

- Designed and implemented the frontend for the science publication website, including the main page with a dynamic article list and interactive account management pages. This setup provides users with easy access to articles and seamless profile management.

- I meticulously adapted the animation of the main card on the website to ensure seamless functionality and visual appeal across a wide range of browsers and devices, including both mobile and desktop platforms.

- I designed and implemented the article pages to dynamically load JSON data by integrating with the backend. This involved developing a solution to fetch and process JSON data from the server and seamlessly display it on the front page of the website.
