# Before College / United States

I was born and raised and Kazkahstan, during my childhood I put a lot of effort in my tennis and grew up playing a lot of proffessional junior tournaments and was a member of national junior tennis team as well. Playing sports at thr big level helped me to get recruited to college in United States and get high quality education. Moreover, competetive spiort taugh me a value of hard work and resilience from the young age which I encorporate in all of my tasks and goals.

# Bachelors Degree

I decided to pick Computer Science as my major because i have a big passion for problem solving and complex tasks. During my time at Monmouth University in New Jersey I was able to take part in different complex projects and **gain experince with several internships**. All of that I was able to do while maintaining **4.0 GPA and being a top tennis player at Division 1 university**. Those 4 years of school tough me time management and team work in class, outside of class and on the court.
